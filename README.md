# linear chaos?
Attempt at a visual/animated proof of fractal complexity from JUST linear equations and random selection of these equations.

## why?
I have had this in my head since I was 19, never made a clear version of it. I used it to create 'magic particle' effects for animations back in 2001 on an amiga, happy that javascript now is WAY more powerful now, then that ever was..
Don't know if an actual proof has been done already (probably)..

I don't really have a plan with this, beyond proving it to my own satisfaction and getting a feel for chaotic systems, 
by exploring this most simple and versatile one.
In other words: Just playing around. Maybe you might even call this... art?

## Possible next steps:
- Check pre existing literature for mention of flares, electric sheep and thousand/million point sculptures based purely on lineair equations.
- prove that it's not artifacts from the random-generator we are seeing here. 
  > This could be easily proven by switching the random algorithm. I tried variants, but no formal page for that yet.
- I feel these are CLEARLY and self evidently fractals. Actual proof might be trying to zoom in and finding the same structures.
- Snapshot editor (zoom in/out, change colors and params, higher dimensions and pointcount)
- Creating an animation from snapshots, timed constantly
- Right now each equation has the same "probability", I might just add a weight and see what that does.
  > This would also allow me to animate between different dimensionalities.
  > I might ALSO give a gateway probability, meaning how likely are you to move from one equation to another? This will do something, no idea what yet.
  > The idea is based on this principle being the basis of many, many processes in nature, and I cannot imagine all opposing forces will be equally interconnected.
  > So I will probably get more matches and be more versatile in the kind of graphs produced, if I make these connections variable and one way. 
  > It would allow for multiple interconnected "overlays" to be composited with these gateways. Which is interesting for the next point :)
- evolving the parameters to match as closely as possible any given image, for it to be used as a possibly ridonculous image compression tool.
- Timing to audio, by having bands/instruments map to parameters.
- 3D pointcloud visualisation and Blender Export, just for fun and bragging rights on youtube..
- Possible application describing/matching/predicting clusters in deep neural maps?
- Calculating the fractal dimension and searching for a parameter correlation. 
   > a bit hard-boiled to my taste, seems like work.. but if anybody wants to, I'd be interested in the results.. I feel there is a connection, where more balanced opposing forces (shrink/grow, translate left/right) lead to a lower fractal dimension.
