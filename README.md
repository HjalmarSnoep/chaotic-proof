# chaotic-proof
Attempt at proof of fractal complexity from linear equations.
I have had this in my head since I was 19, never made a clear version of it. I used it to create 'magic particle' effects for animations back in 2001.
Don't know if it has been done already (probably, but hey)..

I don't really have a plan with this, beyond proving it to my own satisfaction and getting a feel for chaotic systems, 
by exploring this most simple and versatile one.
In other words: Just playing around. Maybe you might even call this... art?

Possible next steps:
- Check pre existing literature for mention of flares, electric sheep and thousand/million point sculptures based on lineair equations.
- Calculating the fractal dimension and searching for a parameter correlation.
- Snapshot editor (zoom in/out, change colors and params, higher dimensions and pointcount)
- Creating an animation from snapshots, timed constantly
- Timing to audio, by having bands/instruments map to parameters.
- 3D pointcloud visualisation and Blender Export, just for fun and bragging rights on youtube..
- Possible application in deep neural maps?
