# chaotic-proof
Attempt at proof of fractal complexity from linear equations.
I have had this in my head since I was 19, never made a clear version of it. I used it to create 'magic particle' effects for animations back in 2001 on an amiga, happy that javascript now is WAY more powerful now, then that ever was..
Don't know if an actual proof has been done already (probably)..

I don't really have a plan with this, beyond proving it to my own satisfaction and getting a feel for chaotic systems, 
by exploring this most simple and versatile one.
In other words: Just playing around. Maybe you might even call this... art?

Possible next steps:
- Check pre existing literature for mention of flares, electric sheep and thousand/million point sculptures based purely on lineair equations.
- Snapshot editor (zoom in/out, change colors and params, higher dimensions and pointcount)
- Creating an animation from snapshots, timed constantly
- Timing to audio, by having bands/instruments map to parameters.
- 3D pointcloud visualisation and Blender Export, just for fun and bragging rights on youtube..
- Possible application in deep neural maps?
- Calculating the fractal dimension and searching for a parameter correlation. 
   (a bit nerdy to my taste, but if anybody wants to, please.. I feel there is a connection, where more balanced opposing forces (shrink/grow, translate left/right) lead to a lower fractal dimension.)

## examples of sets of 6 linear equations (3x2) for two dimensional fractals
I feel these are CLEARLY and self evidently fractals.
Actual proof might be trying to zoom in and finding the same structures.
